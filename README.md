In this Project we will work on customizing our printf. But now I would like you to edit this printf to be sure you can pull and push requests to Github from the cloned repo.
make sure you are on your Master, because if you are on your main branch and I, on master branch, there will be conflict in our push and pull requests. if any of this is present inform me lets tackle this on time bro.
